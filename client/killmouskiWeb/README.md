# React + Vite
## Based on the React + Vite template provided in Visual Studio

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is where we've built the client side of our project using the aforementioned architecture. We've installed a suite of packages, namely:
axios, bootstrap, chart.js, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, socket.io-client, three.
chart.js ended up going unused, but we will keep it for the possibility of future use and implementation.
